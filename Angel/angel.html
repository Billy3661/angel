   <p>3.Actually she's the only girl in my contact list that has been of benefit to me,,
     more so in school,,,sharing revision materials,,, idk I just like her

</p>
   <p>

     making it easier to build and maintain our relationship.
   </p>
   <p> 3.Support System: We can support each other through the challenges of school and be there for one another during stressful times.
</p>
   <p>
    4.Understanding: Since we're both students, we understand the pressures and demands of college life,
     which can help us empathize with each other's struggles.
  </p>
   <p>  5.Study Partner: We can help each other with coursework and exams, potentially improving our academic performance.
</p>

 <h3>Cons</h3>

 <p>2.Rumors and Gossip: Relationships can sometimes attract unwanted attention and speculation from others.
</p>
